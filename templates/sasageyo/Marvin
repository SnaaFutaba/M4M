SUBJECT_LINE: Support for Bullying and Harrassment Policy Reform
BODY:
To Marvin Ridge Administration, 
I, ${Name}, am a student at Marvin Ridge High School. I have become concerned about the culture of bullying and more specifically bullying based on religion, race, sexuality, gender, national origin, ability, or socioeconomic status. Therefore, I am writing in to voice my support for holding these bullies accountable for their actions and educating students and staff about the lives and struggles of marginalized people.
